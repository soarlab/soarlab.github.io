abstract: "<p>
The detection and elimination of data races in large-scale OpenMP programs is
of critical importance. Unfortunately, today's state-of-the-art OpenMP race
checkers suffer from high memory overheads and/or miss races. In this paper, we
present Sword, a data race detector that significantly improves upon these
limitations. Sword limits the application slowdown and memory usage by
utilizing only a bounded, user-adjustable memory buffer to collect targeted
memory accesses. When the buffer fills up, the accesses are compressed and
flushed to a file system for later offline analysis. Sword builds on an
operational semantics that formally captures the notion of concurrent accesses
within OpenMP regions. An offline race checker that is driven by these semantic
rules allows Sword to improve upon happens-before techniques that are known to
mask races. To make its offline analysis highly efficient and scalable, Sword
employs effective self-balancing interval-tree-based algorithms. Our
experimental results demonstrate that Sword is capable of detecting races even
within programs that use over 90% of the memory on each compute node. Further,
our evaluation shows that it matches or exceeds the best available dynamic
OpenMP race checker in detection capability while remaining efficient in
execution time.
