abstract: "<p>
We present FailAmp, a novel LLVM program transformation algorithm that makes
programs employing structured index calculations more robust against
soft-errors. Without FailAmp, an offset error can go undetected; with FailAmp,
all subsequent offsets are relativized, building on the faulty one. FailAmp can
exploit ISAs such as ARM to further reduce overheads. We verify correctness
properties of FailAMP using an SMT solver, and present a thorough evaluation
using many HPC benchmarks under a fault injection campaign. FailAmp provides
full soft-error detection for address calculation while incurring an average
overhead of around 5%.
