abstract: "<p>
Testing is currently the main technique adopted by the industry for improving
the quality, reliability, and security of software. In order to lower the cost
of manual testing, automatic testing techniques have been devised, such as
random and symbolic testing, with their respective trade-offs. For example,
random testing excels at fast global exploration of software, while it plateaus
when faced with hard-to-hit numerically-intensive execution paths. On the other
hand, symbolic testing excels at exploring such paths, while it struggles when
faced with complex heap class structures. In this paper, we describe an
approach for automatic unit testing of object-oriented software that integrates
the two techniques. We leverage feedback-directed unit testing to generate
meaningful sequences of constructor+method invocations that create rich heap
structures, and we in turn further explore these sequences using dynamic
symbolic execution. We implement this approach in a tool called JDoop, which we
augment with several parameters for fine-tuning its heuristics; such knobs
allow for a detailed exploration of the various trade-offs that the proposed
integration offers.
