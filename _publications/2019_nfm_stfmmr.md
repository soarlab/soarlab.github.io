abstract: "<p>
Reasoning about mixed real and floating-point constraints is essential for
developing accurate analysis tools for floating-point programs. This paper
presents FPRoCK, a prototype tool for solving mixed real and floating-point
formulas. FPRoCK transforms a mixed formula into an equisatisfiable one over the
reals. This formula is then solved using an off-the-shelf SMT solver. FPRoCK is
also integrated with the PRECiSA static analyzer, which computes a sound
estimation of the round-off error of a floating-point program. It is used to
detect infeasible computational paths, thereby improving the accuracy of
PRECiSA.
