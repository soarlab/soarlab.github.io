abstract: "<p>
We present OL1V3R, a solver for the SMT floating-point theory that is based on
stochastic local search (SLS). We adapt for OL1V3R the key ingredients of
related work on leveraging SLS to solve the SMT fixed-sized bit-vector theory,
and confirm its effectiveness by comparing it with mature solvers. Finally, we
discuss the limitations of OL1V3R and propose solutions to make it more
powerful.
